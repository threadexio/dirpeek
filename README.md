# Dirpeek

Yet another directory buster

Another directory buster written in C++

---------------------------------------

### Why though?

Because I wanted to make code something in C++ that actually did something sort of useful


### And why should I use it?

Honestly you shouldn't, there are much better alternatives,<br>
[here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) is an example

---------------------------------------

## Installation

##### 1. Clone this repo somewhere
```
git clone https://github.com/threadexio/dirpeek
```

##### 2. Build the binary
```
sudo make
```
This will download and build all the required libraries as well as the final binary

##### 3. Done
If all goes according to plan you will end up with a `dirpeek` binary in the `build` directory

## But it sucks...

Totally agree with you,<br>
but I'm not smart nor experienced enough to code something better
